start indicates at what number the generator should start (default 0)

stop indicates beyond which number the generator should stop, this number will not be included
    *note that beyond depends on whether you are going "up" or "down" i.e. whether step is positive or negative

step indicates what should be added to start each step. step should bring the current value closer to stop
